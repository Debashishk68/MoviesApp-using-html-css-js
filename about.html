    <p>This project, developed by me, Debashish Karmakar, involved creating a comprehensive website using HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript. The primary goal was to showcase a curated collection of movies and shows sourced through APIs from
      TMDb (The Movie Database). By leveraging TMDb's APIs, I was able to dynamically populate the website with
      up-to-date content, including movie details, ratings, and images.

      To enhance the user experience, I integrated the Swiper package, a powerful JavaScript library, to implement an
      engaging slider component. This allowed for seamless navigation and presentation of featured content, making the
      website more interactive and visually appealing.

      Throughout the development process, I focused on optimizing performance and ensuring responsiveness across
      different devices. The combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and third-party APIs enabled me to create a modern,
      data-driven website that offers an immersive experience for users interested in discovering new movies and shows.

      In summary, this project showcases my proficiency in web development, particularly in utilizing APIs and
      integrating external libraries to deliver a dynamic and engaging online platform for entertainment enthusiasts.
